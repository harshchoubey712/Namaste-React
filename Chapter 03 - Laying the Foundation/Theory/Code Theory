import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

// Creating a React element without using JSX
const heading = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { id: "heading" },
  "Namaste React ðŸš€"
);

// Logging the React element to the console
console.log(heading);

// Creating a root for the React application and rendering the 'heading' element
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(heading);

Â· The file starts by importing React and the ReactDOM client, which are used to create React elements and interact with the DOM.
Â· A React element is created using React.createElement, which specifies an h1 tag with the id of "heading" and the text "Namaste React ðŸš€".
Â· The console.log(heading) statement is likely for debugging purposes to log the created React element to the console.
Â· ReactDOM.createRoot is then used to create a root DOM container from the element with the id of "root" in the index.html file.
Â· Finally, root.render(heading) renders the heading element into the root container in the DOM.


Summary
The code in these images demonstrates the basic setup of a React application, where an HTML file provides the shell of the application, and the React code manages the content dynamically. The index.html contains a div element where the React application will attach its components. The App.js file contains React code that creates a simple h1 element and renders it into the root div, replacing any content that was originally there.
Please note that the static content in index.html (the <h1>Akshay is here!</h1>) would be replaced by the content generated by React when the App.js script runs.
 
 
Note:
Namste react
React.createelement will create a react object and once we render then this object will convert to html element.

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

// Creating a React element without JSX
const heading = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { id: "heading" },
  "Namaste React ðŸš€"
);

// Logging the created React element to the console
console.log(heading);

// JSX is transpiled by Babel before it reaches the browser. This comment explains that JSX is not native JavaScript and needs to be transformed into a format that browsers can understand, a process typically handled by Babel and integrated into build tools like Parcel.

// Defining a JSX element for a heading
const jsxHeading = (
  <h1 className="head" tabIndex="5">
    Namaste React using JSX ðŸš€
  </h1>
);


// Logging the created JSX element to the console
console.log(jsxHeading);

// Creating the root element where the React application will mount
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

// Rendering the JSX element into the root of the application
root.render(jsxHeading);


The code in the image is a React application written in JavaScript. It demonstrates creating a simple React element using both the traditional React.createElement method and the more modern JSX syntax. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Creating React Element without JSX:
				Â· const heading = React.createElement("h1", { id: "heading" }, "Namaste React ðŸš€");
This line of code creates a React element that represents an h1 HTML element with an id of "heading" and the text "Namaste React ðŸš€".

Creating React Element with JSX:
				Â· const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">Namaste React using JSX ðŸš€</h1>;
							Â· This line uses JSX, which is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It creates the same h1 element as above but with a more readable and HTML-like syntax.

				Â· root.render(jsxHeading);
							Â· This line instructs React to render the jsxHeading element inside the root container. If the application is using the JSX syntax, this will result in displaying "Namaste React using JSX ðŸš€" inside an h1 tag on the webpage.


Babel is a package which is used to convert jsx  into React.createelemnt which returns a javascript object.
This js object can then be rendered into the DOM AS HTML element.

	â€¢ The comment above the code explains that JSX is transpiled before it reaches the browser using a tool like Babel, which is bundled with Parcel (a web application bundler). Babel converts the JSX syntax into React.createElement calls, which is how React understands and creates elements before they're rendered to the DOM.
The use of JSX syntax is more common in React development than React.createElement because it is more concise and easier to understand at a glance. The Parcel tool mentioned in the comment handles the setup of Babel and other build-time transformations automatically, streamlining the development process.


 The use of className instead of class is a React-specific convention, as class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript. The tabIndex attribute is used to specify the order in which elements will receive focus when navigating through the page using the keyboard

------------------------------------------------

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

// React Element
const heading = (
  <h1 className="head" tabIndex="5">
    Namaste React using JSX ðŸš€
  </h1>
);

// React Functional Component
const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div id="container">
    <h1 className="heading">Namaste React Functional Component</h1>
  </div>
);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<HeadingComponent />);

33. React Element:
	â€¢ The heading constant is assigned a JSX element, which describes a simple heading (h1 tag) with a class name of "head" and a tabIndex of 5. The text inside the heading is "Namaste React using JSX ðŸš€". This is not a component but rather a direct JSX representation of an HTML element.
34. React Functional Component:
	â€¢ HeadingComponent is defined as a functional component that returns a JSX element. This component renders a div with an id of "container", which contains an h1 tag with a class name of "heading" and the text "Namaste React Functional Component". Functional components are a way to create components using functions in React.

35. Rendering the Component:
	â€¢ A root DOM node for the React application is created using ReactDOM.createRoot, targeting the element with the id of "root" in the HTML document.
The root.render method is then called to render the HeadingComponent into the DOM. This tells React to mount the output of HeadingComponent into the root element, replacing whatever is currently inside that DOM element.


-----------------------------------------

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

// Title component defined using JSX
const Title = () => (
  <h1 className="head" tabIndex="5">
    Namaste React using JSX ðŸš€
  </h1>
);

// HeadingComponent that uses Title component
const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div id="container">
    <Title />
    <h1 className="heading">Namaste React Functional Component</h1>
  </div>
);

// Root of the React application
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<HeadingComponent />);


37. Title Component:
	â€¢ Title is a functional component that returns a single h1 element with a class name of head and a tabIndex attribute set to 5. This component will render an h1 tag with the text "Namaste React using JSX ðŸš€".
38. HeadingComponent:
	â€¢ HeadingComponent is another functional component that uses the Title component within a div container. Additionally, it includes another h1 tag with the text "Namaste React Functional Component" and a class name of heading.
39. React DOM Rendering:
	â€¢ The application creates a root container with ReactDOM.createRoot by targeting the DOM element with the id of root. This is the entry point for the React application.
	â€¢ root.render(<HeadingComponent />); is called to render the HeadingComponent within the root container. This mounts the React component onto the page, allowing it to be displayed in the web browser.
This code showcases a basic structure of a React application where smaller components (Title) are composed to create larger components (HeadingComponent). The HeadingComponent is then mounted into the DOM at the root element, which is typically an empty div in the HTML file of the application.

--------------------------------


import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

// A simple React element defined using JSX
const elem = <span>React Element</span>;

// A title element that incorporates the 'elem' React element
const title = (
  <h1 className="head" tabIndex="5">
    {elem}
    Namaste React using JSX ðŸš€
  </h1>
);

// A functional React component that renders 'title' and another heading
const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div id="container">
    {title}
    <h1 className="heading">Namaste React Functional Component</h1>
  </div>
);

// The root of the React application where the 'HeadingComponent' is rendered
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<HeadingComponent />);


45. React Element elem:
	â€¢ elem is a React element that creates a span with the text "React Element". This is done using JSX, which looks similar to HTML.
46. React Element title:
	â€¢ title is a JSX element defining an h1 element with a className of "head" and a tabIndex of "5". Inside this h1, the previously defined elem is included, followed by the text "Namaste React using JSX ðŸš€". The curly braces {elem} are used to embed the React element within the JSX.
47. Functional Component HeadingComponent:
	â€¢ HeadingComponent is a React functional component that returns a div with an id of "container". This div includes the title element and another h1 element with a className of "heading" and the text "Namaste React Functional Component".
48. Rendering the Component:
	â€¢ ReactDOM.createRoot is called to create a root DOM node for the React application. It targets the DOM element with the id of "root" in the HTML file.
	â€¢ The root.render method is then used to render the HeadingComponent into the root DOM node, effectively mounting the React component onto the web page.
This code demonstrates a common pattern in React where small, reusable elements (elem) are combined to build more complex structures (title), which are then used within components (HeadingComponent). The HeadingComponent is what's actually rendered to the page, and it includes both the title element and another h1 element.


--------------------------


import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

// Title component defined using JSX
const Title = () => (
  <h1 className="head" tabIndex="5">
    Namaste React using JSX ðŸš€
  </h1>
);

// HeadingComponent that includes multiple Title components and another heading
const HeadingComponent = () => (
  <div id="container">
     {Title()}
    <Title />
    <Title> </Title>
    <h1 className="heading">Namaste React Functional Component</h1>
  </div>
);

// The root of the React application where the 'HeadingComponent' is rendered
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<HeadingComponent />);

55. Title Component:
	â€¢ Title is a functional React component that returns an h1 element styled with a class "head" and given a tabIndex of 5. This component will display the text "Namaste React using JSX ðŸš€" when rendered.
56. HeadingComponent:
HeadingComponent is another functional React component. It renders a div with the id of "container", containing three instances of the Title component and another h1 element with the class "heading" and the text "Namaste React Functional Component"

This structure is quite typical in React: components are defined, possibly reusing other components, and then a root React component is rendered into an HTML container. The <Title /> component is used multiple times within <HeadingComponent />, demonstrating component reusability, one of the core advantages of React.
